## ⚠️ Pending Tasks (Require Android SDK)

### Prerequisites Required

Before building the Android app, you need to configure the Android SDK:

**Create `local.properties` file** in the project root with your SDK path:

```properties
sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
```

**See `BUILD_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed instructions.**

### Build Tasks (After SDK Setup)

Once `local.properties` is created, run these commands:

#### Debug APK
```bash
.\gradlew.bat clean
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```
**Output:** `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

#### Release APK (Unsigned)
```bash
.\gradlew.bat assembleRelease
```
**Output:** `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk`

#### AAB Bundle (Unsigned)
```bash
.\gradlew.bat bundleRelease
```
**Output:** `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
