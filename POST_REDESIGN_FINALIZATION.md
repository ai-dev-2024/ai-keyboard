## ⚠️ PART 2 — BUILD THE ANDROID APP (Prerequisites)

**Status: PENDING — Gradle Setup Required**

### Prerequisites

Before building, you need to set up the Gradle wrapper:

1. **Option A: Generate Gradle Wrapper (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Install Gradle if not already installed
   # Download from https://gradle.org/install/ or use a package manager
   
   # Generate wrapper
   gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.2
   ```

2. **Option B: Use Android Studio**
   - Open the project in Android Studio
   - Android Studio will automatically set up the Gradle wrapper
   - Use the built-in terminal or Gradle panel to run build commands

3. **Option C: Manual Wrapper Setup**
   - Download Gradle 8.2 from https://gradle.org/releases/
   - Extract and add to PATH
   - Run `gradle wrapper` in the project root

### Build Commands (After Setup)

Once the Gradle wrapper is set up, run:

```bash
# Clean build
.\gradlew.bat clean    # Windows
./gradlew clean        # Linux/Mac

# Build Debug APK
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug    # Windows
./gradlew assembleDebug        # Linux/Mac

# Expected output location:
# app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

---

## ⚠️ PART 3 — INSTALL & RUN THE APP ON A REAL ANDROID DEVICE

**Status: PENDING — Requires Debug APK**

### Prerequisites

1. Enable Developer Options on your Android device:
   - Go to Settings → About Phone
   - Tap "Build Number" 7 times
   - Go back to Settings → Developer Options
   - Enable "USB Debugging"

2. Install ADB (Android Debug Bridge):
   - Download Android SDK Platform Tools: https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools
   - Add to PATH or use full path

### Installation Steps

```bash
# 1. Verify device is detected
adb devices

# 2. Install debug APK
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# 3. Enable IME service
adb shell ime enable com.aikeyboard/.AIKeyboardService

# 4. Set as default keyboard
adb shell ime set com.aikeyboard/.AIKeyboardService

# 5. Manual activation (if needed):
# Open Settings → System → Languages and Input → Keyboards
# Enable "AI Keyboard"
```

### Troubleshooting

- If device not detected: Check USB drivers, try different USB cable/port
- If installation fails: Enable "Install via USB" in Developer Options
- If IME doesn't appear: Restart device or clear app data

## ⚠️ PART 4 — CREATE A RELEASE APK (Unsigned)

**Status: PENDING — Requires Gradle Setup**

### Build Command

```bash
.\gradlew.bat assembleRelease    # Windows
./gradlew assembleRelease        # Linux/Mac
```

### Expected Output

**Location:** `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk`

**Note:** This APK is unsigned and cannot be installed directly. You must sign it first (see Part 6).

---

## ⚠️ PART 5 — CREATE PLAY STORE AAB (Unsigned)

**Status: PENDING — Requires Gradle Setup**

### Build Command

```bash
.\gradlew.bat bundleRelease    # Windows
./gradlew bundleRelease        # Linux/Mac
```

### Expected Output

**Location:** `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

**Note:** This AAB is unsigned. You must sign it before uploading to Play Store (see Part 6).

---

## 📝 PART 6 — SIGNING INSTRUCTIONS (Manual)

### Step 1: Generate a Keystore

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore aikeyboard-release.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias aikeyboard
```

**Important Information to Provide:**
- Keystore password (remember this!)
- Key password (usually same as keystore password)
- Your name and organizational information
- Validity period (10,000 days = ~27 years)

### Step 2: Secure the Keystore

**CRITICAL:** Place the keystore in a safe location **OUTSIDE** the project directory or ensure it's in `.gitignore`.

```bash
# Example: Move to a secure folder
mkdir C:\AndroidKeystores
move aikeyboard-release.jks C:\AndroidKeystores\
```

### Step 3: Create keystore.properties

Copy `keystore.properties.example` to `keystore.properties` and fill in your values:

```properties
storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
keyAlias=aikeyboard
storeFile=C:/AndroidKeystores/aikeyboard-release.jks
```

**⚠️ SECURITY WARNING:**
- **NEVER** commit `keystore.properties` to git
- **NEVER** commit `.jks` files to git
- Add to `.gitignore`:
  ```
  keystore.properties
  *.jks
  *.keystore
  ```

### Step 4: Rebuild Signed Release APK

```bash
.\gradlew.bat clean
.\gradlew.bat assembleRelease
```

**Output:** `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` (signed)

### Step 5: Rebuild Signed Play Store AAB

```bash
.\gradlew.bat bundleRelease
```

**Output:** `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab` (signed)

### Step 6: Verify Signing

```bash
# Verify APK signature
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

# Verify AAB (requires bundletool)
# Download bundletool from: https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases
bundletool verify --bundle=app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```
