# AI Keyboard Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 2024

## Introduction

AI Keyboard is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our keyboard application.

## Data Collection

AI Keyboard operates with a privacy-first approach:

- **No personal data is collected or transmitted**
- **No analytics or tracking is performed**
- **All voice recognition is processed 100% offline on your device**
- **No audio data is sent to external servers**

## Permissions

AI Keyboard requires the following permissions:

### RECORD_AUDIO
Required for voice input functionality. Audio is only recorded when you actively use the voice input feature and is processed entirely on your device. No audio data leaves your device.

### INTERNET
Only used when you explicitly choose to download AI models from a URL. No network activity occurs without your explicit action.

### ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
Used to check network availability before model downloads.

### READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE / READ_MEDIA_AUDIO
Used only when you choose to install models from local files.

## Local Data Storage

The following data is stored locally on your device:

- **Personal dictionary**: Words you add are stored in a local Room database
- **Clipboard history**: Managed locally, never transmitted
- **Keyboard settings and preferences**: Stored locally using DataStore
- **AI models**: Downloaded models are stored in app-private storage

All data remains on your device and is never transmitted to external servers.

## Third-Party Services

AI Keyboard uses the following open-source libraries:

- **ONNX Runtime** (Apache-2.0): For AI model inference
- **Vosk** (Apache-2.0): Alternative speech recognition engine
- **Google Play Billing**: For in-app purchases (if applicable)

None of these services collect or transmit your personal data.

## Children's Privacy

AI Keyboard does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. Since we do not collect any data, this is not applicable.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the app and updating the "Last Updated" date.
