# AI Keyboard — Reddit Launch Post

## Reddit Post (r/Android)

**Title:** AI Keyboard — First Android Keyboard with Fully Offline AI Voice Typing + User-Selectable Models

**Body:**

Hey r/Android! 👋

I'm excited to share **AI Keyboard** — a project I've been working on that combines intelligent typing with AI-powered offline speech recognition.

### 🔒 What Makes It Different?

**100% Offline Voice Typing** — Unlike Gboard or SwiftKey, AI Keyboard processes all voice recognition on-device. Your voice never leaves your device. No cloud servers. No data tracking.

**User-Selectable AI Models** — Choose any ONNX or Vosk ASR model:
- **NVIDIA Parakeet 0.6B** — Best accuracy, multi-language
- **Distil-Whisper ONNX** — Fast, English-only
- **Vosk Small** — Lightweight for low-end devices

You have full control over which AI model processes your voice.

### ✨ Features

- **Modern Keyboard**: Auto-correct, next-word predictions, swipe typing, emoji picker
- **Clipboard Manager**: History, pinning, quick access
- **Custom Themes**: 5+ presets + custom theme creation
- **Privacy-First**: No analytics, no tracking, no data collection
- **Open Source**: Apache-2.0 licensed, built with Jetpack Compose
