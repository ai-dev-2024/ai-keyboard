**Summary:**

AI Keyboard, a groundbreaking new Android keyboard app, is launching with a unique capability no other keyboard offers: fully offline AI voice typing powered by user-selectable ONNX and Vosk models. Built for speed, privacy, and flexibility, AI Keyboard gives users total control over how their device understands their voice.

**Body:**

AI Keyboard is redefining the Android typing experience by combining a modern, customizable keyboard with advanced AI speech recognition — all without sending a single byte of audio to the cloud.

Unlike Google Gboard or Microsoft SwiftKey, which rely on proprietary online speech engines, AI Keyboard lets users install any offline model they want. Popular options include NVIDIA Parakeet (the most accurate offline ASR model available today), Distil-Whisper ONNX, or lightweight Vosk models for low-end devices.

**Feature Highlights:**

• Fully offline speech-to-text  
• User-selectable AI models  
• Modern predictive typing  
• Swipe and gesture input  
• Emoji, GIF, and sticker support  
• Clipboard manager with history  
• Custom themes and layouts  
• Privacy-first architecture  

**Developer Quote:**

"People shouldn't have to choose between convenience and privacy. With AI Keyboard, your typing and your voice stay on your device. You choose the model, and you stay in control."

**Availability:**

AI Keyboard is available on the Google Play Store as a freemium app, with optional Pro features such as premium themes, advanced ASR settings, and additional customization options.
